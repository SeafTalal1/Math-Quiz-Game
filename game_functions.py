# Ultimate Math Challenge Game
# This game presents users with random math problems based on the selected difficulty level.
# The user can choose from four levels: Easy, Medium, Hard, and Insane, each with different operators and operand ranges.
# The goal is to answer as many questions correctly and as quickly as possible.

# Dictionary to store the difficulty levels and their corresponding parameters
